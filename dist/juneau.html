      <h1>Juneau</h1>
      <p class="text-overview">Designing for caregivers is uncharted territory for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.premera.com/wa/visitor/about-premera/">Premera Blue Cross</a>, a healthcare company in Washington and Alaska state. In 11 weeks, we were tasked to research, ideate, and prototype a design concept to help the company explore a potential opportunity in this market segment.</p>
      <p class="text-overview">Juneau is a community app for new and expectant dads - caregivers of their spouses and newborns. Juneau aims to improve the postpartum experience and enhance the transition to parenthood. The platform facilitates a safe environment for dads to connect with one another, share resources, and seek advice.</p>

      <p class="text-overview">The process of designing Juneau features an intensive effort in discovery and problem framing. Our team diverged and converged multiple times in exploring ideas, building prototypes, testing, and refining to arrive at the final concept.

      <p class="text-regular">I collaborated with Yomna and Mengxiao on this project. We bounced ideas off each other during the ideation and participatory design process. Yomna took the lead in building the interface and prototyping in Arduino. Mengxiao took charge of building the high-fidelity crane and creating branding materials.</p>

      <h2>Final Concept</h2>
      <p class="text-regular">Juneau is an app that helps dads navigate through the journey of being a caregiver and the transition to parenthood. Dads can engage in discussion topics that are tailored to their newborn’s stage of development, receiving the right information, at the right time.</p>

    <!-- Postpartum is a complex space -->
    <div class="text-2-9">
      <h2>Postpartum experience is worthy of attention</h2>
      <h3>Literature Reviews</h3>
      <p class="text-regular">After the kickoff meeting with Premera, we spent one week exploring the role of caregivers in the healthcare system. We learned that:</p>
      <ul class="ul-bullet">
        <li>On average, caregivers provide 23 hours of care per week.</li>
        <li>Caregivers are often unrecognized members of the healthcare team. </li>
        <li>It is common for caregivers to have feelings of guilt due to not being able to do more but also wanting to have a balanced life.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-regular">The challenges that caregivers face heavily depend on the care that the patients need. Before we can design for caregivers, first, we need to think from the patients’ perspectives. With further research, we learned that <em>pregnancy and childbirth were the most common reason for hospitalization in the past 10 years in the US.</em> Caring for women postpartum is a rich and complex area that we wanted to explore and help make an impact.</p>

      <h2>New parents find the postpartum journey challenging</h2>
      <h3>Formative research</h3>
      <p class="text-regular">For the next 3 weeks, we dived into the primary research process. There were 12 participants in total. While keeping moms as the main target, we extended the research population to include a wide range of caregiver networks such as spouses, friends, grandparents, and nannies. This allowed our team to get a holistic view of the postpartum experience and the relationship among different stakeholders.</p>

      <p class="text-regular">We selected cultural probe and semi-structured interview as the two main methods since they are good avenues for storytelling.</p>

      <h2>Dads are overlooked</h2>
      <h3>Problem framing</h3>
      <p class="text-regular">While dads are not experiencing the same physical challenges that moms are, they find it hard to find the balance between giving care to their spouses and taking care of newborns.</p>

      <p class="text-regular">From research, we also found that <em>when dealing with stress, men are reluctant to reach out for help due to fear and the social stigma against men showing weakness and vulnerability</em>. About 10% of men reported symptoms of depression following the birth of a child, about double the typical rate of depression in males.</p>

    <!-- Dad insight -->
    <div class="vertical-line text-2-9">
      <p class="text-insight">Dads are seen by both parents as “helping” rather than “sharing” parental responsibilities; this induces stress for their roles as new fathers</p>
      <p class="text-regular">When it comes to breastfeeding, there is limited support that dads can provide. It is often easier for moms to calm crying babies, leaving dads with regular chores and the feeling of not being helpful enough.</p>

      <h3>IDEATION</h3>

      <h3>Down selection</h3>
      <p class="text-2-9 text-regular">At the beginning of the down-selection process, card sorting exercise was used to group similar concepts into categories. With feedback from Premera, we narrowed down to 20 concepts. We then utilized the 6 Thinking Hats framework to select 3 potential concepts: AI Assistant, Caregiver Management, and Parenthood VR Simulation.</p>
      <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
      <p class="text-2-9 text-regular">Initially, we were interested in the VR simulation idea. The VR simulation is centered around parents not feeling prepared for the reality of parenthood. The experience would allow new parents to practice scenarios that would otherwise be impossible to replicate.

      <h2>Take client feedback and pivot</h2>
      <p class="text-regular">We presented 3 concepts to Premera. After the feedback session, we learned that VR wasn’t a feasible option for the company. Besides, from research insights, we learned that parents value the tips and advice they receive from other parents. Instead of reinventing the wheel, the opportunity was to create a platform that could reinforce the existing mental models.</p>

      <p class="text-regular">This is where the concept of Juneau emerged. Juneau helps dads leverage each other’s experience as a resource to navigate through the postpartum journey.</p>
