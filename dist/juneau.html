        <p class=text-regular><a target="_blank" href="https://www.premera.com/wa/visitor/about-premera/">Premera Blue Cross</a>, an insurance company in the PNW tasked our team to explore design opportunities for caregivers.

        <p class="text-regular">Juneau is an app that helps dads navigate through the journey of being a caregiver and the transition to parenthood. Dads can engage in discussion topics that are tailored to their newborn’s stage of development, receiving the right information, at the right time.</p>

      <div class="text-2-4 center-vertical center-horizontal">
        <h3>Explore Diverse Topics</h3>

      <!-- Postpartum is a complex space -->
      <div class="text-2-9">
        <h2>Postpartum experience is worthy of attention</h2>
        <h3>Literature Reviews</h3>
        <p class="text-regular">After the kickoff meeting with Premera, we spent one week exploring the role of caregivers in the healthcare system. We learned that:</p>
        <ul class="ul-bullet">
          <li>On average, caregivers provide 23 hours of care per week.</li>
          <li>Caregivers are often unrecognized members of the healthcare team. </li>
          <li>It is common for caregivers to have feelings of guilt due to not being able to do more but also wanting to have a balanced life.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-regular">The challenges that caregivers face heavily depend on the care that the patients need. Before we can design for caregivers, first, we need to think from the patients’ perspectives. With further research, we learned that <em>pregnancy and childbirth were the most common reason for hospitalization in the past 10 years in the US.</em> Caring for women postpartum is a rich and complex area that we wanted to explore and help make an impact.</p>

        <h2>New parents find the postpartum journey challenging</h2>
        <h3>Formative research</h3>
        <p class="text-regular">For the next 3 weeks, we dived into the primary research process. There were 12 participants in total. While keeping moms as the main target, we extended the research population to include a wide range of caregiver networks such as spouses, friends, grandparents, and nannies. This allowed our team to get a holistic view of the postpartum experience and the relationship among different stakeholders.</p>

        <p class="text-regular">We selected cultural probe and semi-structured interview as the two main methods since they are good avenues for storytelling.</p>

        <h2>Dads are overlooked</h2>
        <h3>Problem framing</h3>
        <p class="text-regular">While dads are not experiencing the same physical challenges that moms are, they find it hard to find the balance between giving care to their spouses and taking care of newborns.</p>

        <p class="text-regular">From research, we also found that <em>when dealing with stress, men are reluctant to reach out for help due to fear and the social stigma against men showing weakness and vulnerability</em>. About 10% of men reported symptoms of depression following the birth of a child, about double the typical rate of depression in males.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Dad insight -->
      <div class="vertical-line text-2-9">
        <p class="text-insight">Dads are seen by both parents as “helping” rather than “sharing” parental responsibilities; this induces stress for their roles as new fathers</p>
        <p class="text-regular">When it comes to breastfeeding, there is limited support that dads can provide. It is often easier for moms to calm crying babies, leaving dads with regular chores and the feeling of not being helpful enough.</p>

        <h3>Down selection</h3>

        <p class="text-regular">At the beginning of the down-selection process, card sorting exercise was used to group similar concepts into categories. With feedback from Premera, we narrowed down to 20 concepts. We then utilized the 6 Thinking Hats framework to select 3 potential concepts: AI Assistant, Caregiver Management, and Parenthood VR Simulation.</p>

      <div class="text-2-9">
        <h3>Storyboarding</h3>

        <p class="text-regular">Initially, we were interested in the VR simulation idea. The VR simulation is centered around parents not feeling prepared for the reality of parenthood. The experience would allow new parents to practice scenarios that would otherwise be impossible to replicate.

        <h2>Take client feedback and pivot</h2>
        <p class="text-regular">We presented 3 concepts to Premera. After the feedback session, we learned that VR wasn’t a feasible option for the company. Besides, from research insights, we learned that parents value the tips and advice they receive from other parents. Instead of reinventing the wheel, the opportunity was to create a platform that could reinforce the existing mental models.</p>

        <p class="text-regular">This is where the concept of Juneau emerged. Juneau helps dads leverage each other’s experience as a resource to navigate through the postpartum journey.</p>

        <p class="text-regular">Juneau's design principles are demonstrated in its mood board: a clean, friendly, and modern style that aims to reach all types of dads. Using blue as the primary color, Juneau seeks to promote serenity and calmness. Using green as a secondary color, Juneau brings positivity and freshness, embodying the transition to parenthood.</p>
        <p class="text-regular">The postpartum journey is challenging and full of the unexpected, Juneau wants to recognize the need for vulnerability and flexibility through the use of soft gradient waves. The curves and blended colors of these waves mimic the northern light, a natural phenomenon that illuminates the dark night sky. All these elements are implemented throughout the app to help bring Juneau's visual identity to live while keeping the experience consistent for users.</p>

As a new dad, it rings true to me...and you’re right, there’s that stigma [that dads are reluctant to rearch out for help]. You need to get those resources ahead of them and I love how you categorized those information like personal well-being, and baby care, etc. for this app.</p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-6">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Extreme users can offer valuable insights</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">We interviewed 1 mom that had her baby in the NICU and 1 dad with a premature baby. These two users helped our team uncover new challenges that we did not think of. Including this audience added another layer of complexity which helped us think about edge cases and unconventional needs, situations, and contexts.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-7-11">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>My background in marketing benefits me as a designer</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">I was able leverage my market research skills to evaluate Juneau’s value proposition and account for implementation feasibility. It further helped me consider common challenges of online communities such as: the network effect, “throw-away” accounts, and lurkers vs. content generators.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-9">
        <h2>What I’d do differently</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-6">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Leverage journey mapping to identify pain points quicker</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">The postpartum experience heavily depends on time (i.e., baby’s stages of development). We should have created a journey map prior to the ideation process to help identify pain points quicker.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-7-11">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Conduct remote usability testing to improve efficiency</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">Postpartum dads have a lot of family responsibilities. It would have been more convenient and efficient for participants if the sessions were conducted remotely.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-9">
        <h2>Next steps</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-6">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Assess Voice User Interface (VUI) in more details</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">We didn’t rank VUI as one of the top ideas during the ideation phase because noises can disrupt babies’ sleeping patterns. As newborns enter later development stages and their sleeping patterns become more consistent, VUI could be a promising medium. The handsfree interaction that VUI offers brings about convenience, especially in contexts where parents need to hold and calm a crying baby.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-7-11">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Consolidate Juneau with Premera’s existing mom app</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">Premera has an app for moms, BestBeginnings. If Juneau was implemented by Premera, the next step is to consolidate both apps to make sure users can have consistent experiences.</p>
