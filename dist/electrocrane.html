      <h1>ElectroCrane</h1>

      <p class="text-overview">Microsoft’s ambition is to “modernize STEM education to enable every student on the planet to achieve more”. The company seeks to expand its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/education-workshop/activity-library.aspx">library</a> so teachers can have more lessons to bring into the classrooms. In 10
        weeks, we worked with Microsoft, teachers, and kids to develop ElectroCrane.</p>

      <p class="text-overview">ElectroCrane is a STEM lesson plan and hands-on activity designed to teach 3rd - 5th grade students about the relationship between electric current and magnetic field. The activity costs ~ $10 per student and is aligned with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/search-standards?keys=&tid%5B%5D=102">Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)</a>.</p>

      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p class="text-overview">My role was most prominent in developing the lesson plan. It includes building the low-fidelity crane and decomposing a step-by-step instruction for students in the classroom. I took ownership of video prototyping, product photography, and video editing.</p>

      <p class="text-regular">I collaborated with Yomna and Mengxiao on this project. We bounced ideas off each other during the ideation and participatory design process. Yomna took the lead in building the interface and prototyping in Arduino. Mengxiao took charge of building the high-fidelity crane and creating branding materials.</p>

    <!-- The Challenge -->
    <div class="text-2-9">
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>

      <img class="quote-svg" src="assets/global/quote-icon.svg" alt="">
      <p class="quote">Our ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of a new generation of students who are more likely to ‘look inside’ the technological artifacts in the world around them and feel empowered to develop their own tools for exploring phenomena in their everyday lives.</p>
      <p class="text-help" style="float:right;">- Mitchel Resnick</p>

      <p class="text-regular" style="padding-top:40px;">Over-reliance on technology could risk future generations losing the connection with the world of craftsmen, a sense of observation, and manual work. </p>

      <p class="text-regular">Without understanding the capabilities and limitations of scientific instruments, learning becomes grasping concepts on the surface. Students only learn the input and output without further investigating how the internal
        components work and relate to each other.</p>

      <p class="text-regular">We worked with Microsoft Education to help produce a STEM lesson plan that could achieve these goals:</p>
      <ol class="ol-custom">
        <li>Align with NGSS standards</li>
        <li>Encourage students to build their own instruments to learn scientific concepts</li>
        <li>Keep the cost of materials less than $10</li>
        <li>Make the activity fun, scrappy, and sparks students’ interests in STEM education</li>
        </<ol>

    <!-- Final Concept -->
    <div class="text-2-9">
      <h2>Final Concept</h2>
      <p class="text-regular">ElectroCrane teaches 3rd-5th grade students about the relationship between electric current and magnetic field. Just like how an electromagnetic crane could pick up metal in a scrap yard, with ElectroCrane, students control the crane arm to pick up paper clips. The lesson comes with 2 interfaces, one for crane control and one for recording experiment results. Students will learn by experimenting, interpreting data, and iterating on their process to build a stronger electromagnet. </p>

      <p class="text-regular" style="padding-bottom:40px;">ElectroCrane eliminates financial barriers to STEM education; it is affordable. The crane is built from everyday materials such as popsicle sticks, rubber bands, paper cups, and cardboard.

    <div class="text-2-9">
      <h2>We can’t know it all, we just need to feel confident enough to move forward </h2>
      <h3> Conduct Literature Reviews</h3>
      <p class="text-regular">Education was a new design territory but waiting to feel 100% confident to start exploring the possibilities isn’t a good strategy. We wanted to establish just enough knowledge and confidence to move forward. We
        reviewed Microsoft’s Hacking STEM library and looked into online communities where teachers share resources with each other.</p>
      <p class="text-regular">I reviewed the literature to understand the education industry as a whole. Thought leaders like Mitchel Resnick and his work on the scientific <a target="_blank" href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/bbb.pdf">“black boxes”</a>, Lee Martin on the “maker movement” for education, are
        all
        great inspiration for this project.</p>
      <p class="text-regular">While familiarizing with a new problem space, I led the effort to recruit teachers for interviews and came up with a plan for a participatory design session with kids. I quickly handled the documentation and the
        outreach process. Once the details and the logistics were managed, our team was able to focus on solving the actual problem: bringing STEM education to the classroom. </p>
      <p class="text-regular">In less than 1 week after receiving the project brief, having just a good level of confidence and comfort, we dived into the ideation process. </p>

    <div class="text-2-9">
      <h2>Go wild first and then refocus</h2>
      <h3>Ideation</h3>
      <p class="text-regular">To come up with as many ideas as possible, we did a sketch storm activity. The reason behind this was to use sketching as a method to externalize our thoughts, visualize the good ideas, and simply empty the bad
        ones
        out of the way. In 1 minute, each person had to come up with an idea and sketch it out on paper. We spent another minute taking turns sharing out that sketch. 20 minutes later, we generated over 30 potentials concepts.</p>

      <h3>concept narrowing</h3>
      <p class="text-regular">We then reviewed and assessed each concept carefully. There were 5 criteria that were taken into consideration: educational, iterative, exciting, feasible, and affordable. Besides, a common interest that emerged
        across our discussions was magnets. There are not many lesson plans teaching about the relationship between electric current and magnetic field. Combining the criteria and team interest, we narrowed down to 3 main concepts: Save the Bee, Wheel
        of
        Fortune, and Magic Board.</p>

    <div class="text-2-9">
      <h2>Ask for feedback early and don’t be afraid to pivot</h2>

      <p class="text-regular">We brought 3 ideas to Microsoft and sought feedback. All three met the requirements yet one critical element was still weak: educational. They were creative and engaging yet they weren’t apparent to the daily
        scientific phenomenon.</p>

      <p class="text-regular">At this step, I helped my team pivot a new concept within the realm of electromagnetism. I looked into the applications of electromagnets in daily life, sketched out a few concepts, and an electromagnetic crane was one of them. I discussed these new concepts with my team and we decided to bring Save the Bee and ElectroCrane to a participatory design session with kids.</p>

      <p class="text-regular">Both ideas received a lot of enthusiasm from the kids in the classroom. From the participatory design session, we learned that kids prefer to collaborate with their peers for class activities. It included
        assembling
        the prototype and interpreting data visualization.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="text-regular">We decided to move forward with ElectroCrane because of 2 reasons:</p>
      <ol class="ol-custom">
        <li>The concept is less abstracted, it resembles the actual vehicle that exists in real life.</li>
        <li>The feedback received was more well-rounded from both Microsoft and kids.</li>

    <div class="text-2-9">
      <h2>Continue to iterate our way to the final product</h2>

      <p class="text-regular">In 2 weeks, we conducted usability studies with 3 teachers and 5 kids to refine the lesson plan, the crane form, and the interface. To quickly receive feedback from teachers without coding a finished concept, we
        employed the Wizard-of-Oz prototyping method. During testing sessions, I made sure the crane function properly and was in charge of camera work. I edited and produced <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/319235518">this video</a> to capture the testing sessions. </p>

    <div class="text-2-9">

      <h3 style="">INSIGHT 3: LACK OF PROPER LABELS</h3>

      <p class="text-regular">Since kids don’t understand physical computing, they rely on imagery and follow exactly how the circuit is illustrated. The current Microsoft’s instruction doesn’t provide enough labels which led to confusion and

      <h2>Evaluating and communicating ideas by doing</h2>
      <p class="text-regular">Articulating scientific concepts isn’t easy. During the process of brainstorming for ideas or iterating the form/interface, there was a few instances where we couldn’t understand each other’s mental models via
        plain
        descriptions. We decided to diverge to make something tangible to communicate our ideas more efficiently. As we started to dive into building the actual form or mock up a quick interface, each of us went through a process of evaluating and
        reflecting on our own concept. When we converged together as a team, having something tangible to show helped ground the conversation to be more productive and we were able to provide very specific, constructive feedback to each other’s work.

    <div class="text-2-9">
      <h2>Develop flexibility when working with kids</h2>
      <p class="text-2-9 text-regular">Working with kids is challenging because it requires designers to be able to properly manage expectations and practice observation. It’s difficult to predict how successful a testing session would be. To work
        effectively with kids, it’s good to break down complex components into simple ones. This specific audience also has a short attention span so it is also important to make the experience fun and engaging for them.

        Another factor that would enhance flexibility in working with audience with specific needs is to clearly define the objectives and pick the right prototyping method. Kids might not understand a low-fidelity walkthrough of paper prototype so
        using
        video prototypes could yield better results. </p>
