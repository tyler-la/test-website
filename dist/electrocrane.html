        <h2>Develop a maker mentality is crucial for modern STEM education</h2>
        <h3>Literature Reviews</h3>
        <p class="text-regular">We started the process by reviewing Microsoft’s Hacking STEM library, reading the NGSS standards, and joining online teachers groups to familiarize ourselves with the process of creating a lesson plan for 3rd - 5th grade students.</p>

        <p class="text-regular">We further looked into journals and white papers to assess the current stage of the education field as a whole. Thought leaders like Mitchel Resnick and his work on the scientific <a target="_blank" href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/bbb.pdf">“black boxes”</a>, Lee Martin on the “maker movement” are all great inspiration for this project.

      <div class="text-2-9">
        <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="vertical-line text-2-9">
        <p class="text-insight">Over-reliance on technology could risk future generations losing the connection with the world of craftsmen, a sense of observation, and manual work</p>
        <p class="text-regular">Without understanding the capabilities and limitations of scientific instruments, learning becomes grasping concepts on the surface. Students only learn the input and output without further investigating how the internal components work and relate to each other.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="vertical-line text-2-9">
        <p class="text-insight">Situating students in real-world experiences can promote inquiry-based learning</p>
        <p class="text-regular">With hands-on projects, students can develop the ability to ask good questions, develop frustration resistant, craft conceptual armatures, and relate understanding to other subjects.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="vertical-line text-2-9">
        <p class="text-insight">Mastery of core skills can help kids develop curiosity, autonomy, and interest in STEM education</p>
        <p class="text-regular">One of the barriers to STEM education is the lack of foundational knowledge. Introducing STEM education early on via fun and engaging activities can help spark more interests among kids.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-9">
        <p class="text-regular">While familiarizing with a new problem space, I led the effort to recruit teachers for interviews and came up with a plan for a participatory design session with kids. I quickly handled the documentation and the outreach process. Once the details and the logistics were managed, our team was able to focus on solving the actual problem: bringing STEM education to the classroom. </p>
        <p class="text-regular">In less than 1 week after receiving the project brief, having just a good level of confidence and comfort, we dived into the ideation process. </p>

      <div class="text-2-9">
        <h2>Go wild first and then refocus</h2>
        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p class="text-regular">To come up with as many ideas as possible, we did a sketch storm activity. The reason behind this was to use sketching as a method to externalize our thoughts, visualize the good ideas, and simply empty the bad
          ones
          out of the way. In 1 minute, each person had to come up with an idea and sketch it out on paper. We spent another minute taking turns sharing out that sketch. 20 minutes later, we generated over 30 potentials concepts.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-2-9">

        <h3>Concept narrowing</h3>
        <p class="text-regular">We then reviewed and assessed each concept carefully. There were 5 criteria that were taken into consideration: educational, iterative, exciting, feasible, and affordable. Besides, a common interest that emerged
          across our discussions was magnets. There are not many lesson plans teaching about the relationship between electric current and magnetic field. Combining the criteria and team interest, we narrowed down to 3 main concepts: Save the Bee, Wheel
          of Fortune, and Magic Board.</p>

        <h2>Ask for feedback early and don’t be afraid to pivot</h2>

        <p class="text-regular">We brought 3 ideas to Microsoft and sought feedback. All three met the requirements yet one critical element was still weak: educational. They were creative and engaging yet they weren’t apparent to the daily
          scientific phenomenon.</p>

        <p class="text-regular">At this step, I helped my team pivot a new concept within the realm of electromagnetism. I looked into the applications of electromagnets in daily life, sketched out a few concepts, and an electromagnetic crane was one of them. I discussed these new concepts with my team and we decided to bring Save the Bee and ElectroCrane to a participatory design session with kids.</p>

        <p class="text-regular">Both ideas received a lot of enthusiasm from the kids in the classroom. From the participatory design session, we learned that kids prefer to collaborate with their peers for class activities. It included
          assembling
          the prototype and interpreting data visualization.</p>

          <li>The feedback received was more well-rounded from both Microsoft and kids.</li>

        <h2>Continue to iterate our way to the final product</h2>

        <p class="text-regular">In 2 weeks, we conducted usability studies with 3 teachers and 5 kids to refine the lesson plan, the crane form, and the interface. To quickly receive feedback from teachers without coding a finished concept, we
          employed the Wizard-of-Oz prototyping method. During testing sessions, I made sure the crane function properly and was in charge of camera work. I edited and produced <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/319235518">this video</a> to capture the testing sessions. </p>

        <h3 style="">Feedback 3: LACK OF PROPER LABELS</h3>

        <p class="text-regular">Since kids don’t understand physical computing, they rely on imagery and follow exactly how the circuit is illustrated. The current Microsoft’s instruction doesn’t provide enough labels which led to confusion and
          drop-off in the process.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Design response 3 -->
      <div class="text-2-9">
        <h3 style="">RESPONSE 3: PROVIDE CLEAR LABELS </h3>

        <p class="text-regular">I suggested my team to gray out irrelevant components on the circuit illustration & add detailed labels so kids can follow the instruction more easily.</p>

        <p class="text-regular">Our team applied the insights and revised ElectroCrane. I took the lead in finalizing the low-fidelity crane and the lesson plan. Yomna worked on polishing the interface, and Mengxiao created a high-fidelity crane.As a part of the final deliverable, I created a storyboard, produced a 2-minute video, and animated the logo to pitch ElectroCrane at Microsoft.</p>

      <div class="text-1-5 center-horizontal">
        <p class="text-regular">Mengxiao, Yomna, and I pitched ElectroCrane at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, WA. We presented the concept, let visitors play with the crane, and addressed all questions and clarifications. We received great compliments on our well-rounded execution regarding the lesson plan, interfaces, and the video.</p>

        <p class="quote">I think this is a great app that we should have pursued. As a new dad, it rings true to me...and you’re right, there’s that stigma [that dads are reluctant to rearch out for help]. You need to get those resources ahead of them and I love how you categorized those information like personal well-being, and baby care, etc. for this app.</p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-6">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Making is a form of thinking</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">While brainstorming, there were a few instances where we couldn’t understand each other’s idea via plain descriptions. As we constructed a rough prototype or mocked up a quick wireframe, we each went through the process of evaluating and reflecting our own concepts. When we converged, we were able to articulate better, have richer understanding, and engage in a more productive conversation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-7-11">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Assess what feedback you want to get & choose the right prototyping method</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">Sometimes we don't need to have a functional prototype to get feedback from users. I applied this to the process which helped my team quickly test ElectroCrane concept via simple videos. Besides, our team successfully implemented Wizard-of-Oz prototyping prior to coding which helped us avoid technical debts.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-9">
        <h2>What I’d do differently</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-6">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Get feedback from teachers earlier</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">The reason we fell into the "pit of despair" at the end of our ideation process was because we didn't get feedback early enough. Even though the issue got resolved via rapid prototyping and iterations, we could have been more efficient by involving teachers early on in the process.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-7-11">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Reach out to kids beyond UW KidsTeam to assess the learning curve for first-time users</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">The kids that we worked with were from UW KidsTeam; they have been trained to work with prototypes and provide feedback. For both participatory design sessions, we tested with the same group of kids. It was hard to assess the real learning curve of ElectroCrane because they were already familiar with our projects.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-9">
        <h2>Next steps</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="text-2-6">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Test in the classroom</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">Even though ElectroCrane received great feedback from teachers and kids, there's still so much to learn if we could test the concept in an actual classroom.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-7-11">
        <p class="text-regular"><em>Translate the lesson plan into different languages</em></p>
        <p class="text-regular">Microsoft Education's mission is to make STEM education accessible to every kid on the planet. Our team has a diverse background and language capabilities. I'd love to translate the lesson plan into another language to help Microsoft get closer to achieving the mission.</p>
